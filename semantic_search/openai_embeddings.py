    st.write("### Here's how it works:")
    st.write("1. First, the embedding API converts each piece of text into a vector representation using a pre-trained language model. This vector represents the meaning and context of the text.")
    st.write("2. The cosine similarity function then takes these two vectors and calculates the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine similarity score ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that the two vectors are identical, 0 indicates that they are completely dissimilar, and -1 indicates that they are exact opposites.")
    st.write("3. This cosine similarity score is then used to determine the similarity between the two pieces of text. For example, if the cosine similarity score is close to 1, the two pieces of text are likely very similar in meaning, while a score close to 0 suggests that they are completely different.")
    st.write("Overall, cosine similarity is a powerful tool for comparing the semantic similarity between two pieces of text, and OpenAI's embedding API makes it easy to implement this technique in your own projects.")
